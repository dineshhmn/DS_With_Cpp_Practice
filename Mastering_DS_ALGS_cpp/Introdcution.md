# Mastering DS and Algs using C++

DS covered With types:

Physical DS (No logic to use structure)
- Array
- Matrices
- Linked Lists

Logical DS (logic to use structure)
- Stack
- Queues
- Trees
- Graph
- Hashing

What you need to understand
- How the DS works in and out and how to code them
- You need to know internal details, and are able to choose and analyze based on use case

Every language is suitable for DS work, almost all lang provide built in DS ex: python collections and **STL in Cpp**
and **DOM in JS**

Unfortunately, C does not have built in DS, hence we have to build our DS and we will also use them for Cpp

Other than these topics, we will learn **Recursion and Sorting**

### Stack and Heap
- Stack and Heap are memory locations where the running program is stored
  - Each program has a stack memory location for static objects
  - Each program also has a Heap Memory for Dynamic Memory allocation (malloc)

### Types of DS
- Physical and Logical

**Physical**
Describe how data is stored in memory
- Arrays
- LinkedLists

**Logical**
Describe how data is added/removed/searched/.. in a DS
Sub categorized into Linear, Non-Linear and Tabular
- Linear: Stack and Queue
- Non-Linear: Trees and Graphs
- Tabular: hash tables

### Abstract Data Type
Let us consider a group of data objects 8,3,9,4,6,10,12

I can store them in as an abstract array if we can get the following
- space for storage
- capacity
- size

On this abstract array, we define operations that can do things on this array like
- append
- search
- delete
- overwrite
- count
- sort, etc

A **Data Type** is a standard object that can store values and operate on them
An Abstract data type is a user defined data type that you can create and define

### Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: Analysis and optimization of program to calculate how much time does the task take
Space Complexity:  Analysis and optimization of program to calculate how much memory does the task take
